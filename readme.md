# GodotSteam's Skillet

Designed to showcase the features of GodotSteam; packing in as many of the Steam classes as possible.  The game being shared as open-source will allow developers to see how things work in Steamworks and Godot with real-world examples. Users may copy and modify the code for their own needs and games.  Since it is meant to be educational, it will be designed in a somewhat simplified way to accommodate all levels.

Obviously, not all of Skillet's code is available yet. Scripts and scenes will be added when they are deemed "completed enough" for public use.

[You can find the game on Steam here.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3013040/Skillet/)  While not out yet, you can wishlist it now; it should be released sometime in mid-2025.
